	Which means we tried a lot of things.

	My favorite part of this product is that we never refactored prematurely.
	We only pivoted when necessary to scale.
	When I say scale I mean code, performance, but also team size.

	Backbone allowed us to do this gracefully

    I realized I needed a collection object, then I needed templates...

   Interactive Prototype
</section>

<!--

    This is what most people think of when they hear prototype.
    A fully fleshed out, high fidelity prototype to express final intent.
    From my experience the expectation of these types of prototypes is that the code will be 100% rewritten and that the interaction most likely won't be able to be reproduced in a "Real" application.

    More times than not interactive prototypes are thought to represent an "Ideal" that in reality is not possible.
    I make my interactive prototypes in as close to the final code base I can while not wasting time.

<section class="slide floatdrag">
    Functional Prototype
</section>

<!--

    Functional prototypes I define as a rough pass to establish a direction.
    These I try to timebox to a day.
    The idea is to express that a direction is possible both technically and functionally.

<section class="slide historymanager">
	Architectural Prototype
</section>

<!--

Architectural prototypes are used for code design pattern validation.
These are done in support of features that are hard to estimate due to unknown amounts of code refactoring.
Allows you to compartmentalize the code patterns and how they can work together in the final product.

	Key role in any product
	The importance it too often overlooked

	"You prototype the things you don't think are possible."

	There is a difference between a
		- prototype
			- Internal
				- to the team to illustrate a point or prove something is viable
		- demo
			- External
				- Usually for stakeholders buy in
		- production
			- Design patterns
			- Basis for shipping code

	Knowing when to pivot in order to meet the needs of each of these goals is critical to the success of a product
